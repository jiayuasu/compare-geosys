## Install GeoSpark

Before starting the GeoSpark journey, you need to make sure your Apache Spark cluster is ready.

There are two ways to use a Scala or Java library with Apache Spark. You can user either one to run GeoSpark.

* Spark interactive Scala shell: easy to start, good for new learners to try simple functions
* Self-contained Scala / Java project: a steep learning curve of package management, but good for large projects
